## Voice controlled python program
### Beginner project to start for different python libraries

Libraries that have been used so far:
- pyttsx3 (needs to install)
- speech_recognition (needs to install)
- datetime(default)
- wikipedia(needs to install)
- smtplib(default)
- webbrowser(default)
- os(default)

One can easily modify it and can turn the simple logic to vast AI logic.
